# EseOkonofuaDotCom [website](http://eokonofua.com)
Source code for my current website. 

<img height="400" src="https://github.com/EseOkonofua/EseOkonofuaDotCom/blob/master/eokonofuadotcom.PNG" />

Not my proudest work but was built in a span of 3 days for job applications and was built in my earlier stages of node.js development.
It contains basic information about me, work experience and highlights some of my projects. 

Attached to this website is also a little socket experiment I tried on the **/socket** route, with making multiplayer games. The game is not fully functional or optimized but shows proof of concept for multiplayer games with Socket.io.

Try opening up 2 browsers and giving the multiplaer a whirl.


##EseOkonofuaDotCom2 is in the works!
